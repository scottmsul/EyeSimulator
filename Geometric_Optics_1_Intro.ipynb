    "We define a coordinate system with two axes, the $z$-axis in which light is propagating forwards, and the $y$-axis which is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. As a ray of light travels forwards, at each $z$ it has some height $y$ and is pointing in some direction $\\theta$. We can think of each individual light ray as a vector:\n",
